# Node.js Server Unexpected Crash

This repository demonstrates a Node.js server that crashes unexpectedly after handling a certain number of requests.  The issue highlights the importance of proper error handling and resource management in Node.js applications.

## Problem Description

A simple HTTP server is implemented using Node.js's `http` module. Under normal operation, the server should continuously listen for and respond to incoming requests. However, after a variable number of requests (seemingly random), the server crashes without any clear error messages in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and resource management to prevent crashes and provide informative error messages.
